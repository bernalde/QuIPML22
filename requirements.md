## Student resources.

If you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121, getchell@cmu.edu.

As a student, you may experience various challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, and/or lack of motivation.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities.
